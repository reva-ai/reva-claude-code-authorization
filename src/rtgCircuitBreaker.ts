// A per-SESSION "stop calling the RTG, just allow" latch, opened after a 401
// and checked at the top of evaluate() before any network call. Once a
// session sees a 401 it is written off for that session: every later call in
// it short-circuits, and nothing re-checks. A NEW session always starts
// clean and makes a real RTG call, however many times an earlier session
// failed.
//
// This replaces a 4-hour window keyed by Agent id. Two things were wrong
// with that. It was keyed per MACHINE, so one session's 401 silenced every
// other session on the box, including ones started after the underlying
// problem was fixed. And nothing ever closed it on success — the only exits
// were waiting out four hours or deleting the file — so a user whose licence
// was repaired five minutes in still had almost four hours of ungoverned
// operation ahead, with no call ever reaching the RTG to notice the repair.
//
// Session scope fixes both without needing recovery logic inside a session:
// the blast radius is one session, and starting a new one is the recovery.
//
// There is deliberately NO expiry here. openedAt is recorded for logging and
// nothing reads it for a decision — the file existing IS the open state.
//
// 401 is the only status that opens this (see rtgClient.ts). Everything else
// operational — 403/404/424/429/5xx, transport failures, timeouts — already
// fails CLOSED on every call, so there is no "keep allowing" window to bound.

// so its id will never be seen again and the marker cannot affect any
